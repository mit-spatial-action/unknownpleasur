Description: A set of function for producing ridgelines at arbitrary angles from 'terra'
            objects. While ridgeline plots are well-supported in the 'ggplot' ecosystem,
            particularly by the 'ggridges' package, the functions provided here differ in
            that lines (or enclosed polygons) are returned as 'sf' objects that are either 
            offset using an affine transform or returned with a Z component. This support 
            export to and visualization with a geographic information system or interactive 
            mapping tool.
