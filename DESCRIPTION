Description: A set of function for producing ridgelines at arbitrary
    angles from 'terra' objects. While ridgeline plots are well-supported
    in the 'ggplot' ecosystem, particularly by the 'ggridges' package, the
    functions provided here differ in that lines (or enclosed polygons)
    are returned as 'sf' objects that are either offset using an affine
    transform or returned with a Z component. This support export to and
    visualization with a geographic information system or interactive
    mapping tool.
